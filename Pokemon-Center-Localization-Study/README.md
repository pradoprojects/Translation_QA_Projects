Case Study: Pokémon Center Localization (PT-BR)

🎯 Objective
To demonstrate a strategic localization approach for the Pokémon Center e-commerce platform, focusing on the Brazilian market. This study explores how linguistic precision and UX writing can drive engagement and revenue, especially considering major global events like the 2026 World Cup in the USA.

💡 Business Rationale
Market Gap: Brazil has one of the world's most loyal Pokémon fanbases, yet the Pokémon Center lacks a localized experience.

Strategic Timing: The 2026 World Cup will bring a massive influx of Brazilian tourists to the US. A localized digital/physical interface reduces purchase friction for high-intent consumers with limited English proficiency.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
CAT Tool: MemoQ (handling tags, terminology consistency, and QA).

UX/UI Focus: Adaptation of "UI Strings" (Checkout, Navigation, Tooltips) to ensure natural flow and prevent text truncation.

Style Guide Adherence: Strict following of official TPCi terminology (e.g., gender consistency for Pokémon names).

📄 Documentation
Included in this repo is a Context Notes document detailing the rationale behind specific editorial choices (e.g., maintaining sub-brand identity vs. functional translation).
